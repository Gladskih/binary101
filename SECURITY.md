# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Binary101 is an experimental, research-focused project. There is no formal security support policy, but good-faith reports of vulnerabilities are welcome and appreciated.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security issue:

- Prefer private disclosure when possible.
- If GitHub security advisories are enabled for this repository, use them to report the issue.
- If private channels are not available, open a GitHub issue with a high-level description and avoid sharing exploit details or sensitive data.

Please include:

- A short description of the issue and where it occurs.
- Steps to reproduce, if possible.
- Any suggested mitigations or workarounds.

Maintainers will review the report, assess impact, and decide on fixes or mitigations as time allows.
